## Ceremony Protocols

**What do I do when the soldiers salute?**
The military salutes in a variety of situations. If you are not in the military, or are in civilian clothes, you are invited to place your right hand over your heart when the soldiers salute during a military funeral. You can cue off what the soldiers are doing to know when to place your hand over your heart.

**How do I honor the flag?**
The general rules of thumb are: If you are moving past the flag and it is not moving, place your right hand over your heart as you pass. If you are standing still and the flag is passing, place your hand over your heart as the flag passes.

**What should I do if I have other protocol questions?**
When in doubt, ask! The Cemetery Representative, who represents Arlington National Cemetery at every service, would be delighted to explain it all to you.

**Can I take pictures?**
Yes. All photos and the video taken by Mattox photography will also be shared.
